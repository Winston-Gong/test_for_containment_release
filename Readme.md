Example code in local_example.R provide quick local simulation for demonstration. Run the script to generate a synthetic population and outbreaks on it. 

Example simulation have following specification:

    1. Population size = 200

    2. 

# ## Code structure



# ## Full scale simulation on Linux-based cluster
